This is the post title
======================

This is the post body, in **Markdown**.

It will continue for the rest of the file. See, the top is a lot like an HTTP response with headers, but with a title and a row of any number of equals signs ("===") as the first two headers.

You can add arbitrary fields, formatted like HTTP headers.

You can then customize the templates to respond to them.

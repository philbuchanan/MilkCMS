The post body is written in **Markdown**.

The title of the post should be on the first line of the file with any number of "=" symbols directly below it.

You can add arbitrary metadata fields to your posts, like the "Tags" above. The syntax is Field: value. Each one should be placed on it's own line, immediately after the "=" row.

Configuration files are found in the /site/config folder. Feel free to edit these settings to your liking.

You can then customize the template in the /site/template folder.
